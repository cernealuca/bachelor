The South Carpathian are bounded by the Dambovita Valley on the east and by the Danube on the south-west. They consist of crystalline schists and, here and there, Paleozoic non-metamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed rocks gas well gas Mesozoic deposition. The crystalline formation and the Paleozoic deposition are sometimes crossed by igneous rocks, especially by granodiorites and granodiorites. The South Carpathian are characterized by a nappe structure. The autochthon, generally, consist of epizone schists with granitic intrusions and sedimentary deposition that rise up to the Upper Cretaceous on the stratigraphic scale. The formation overlying the autochthon tectonically make up the Getic Nappe and consist especially of crystalline schists that are overlain by Paleozoic and Mesozoic deposition. The latter are sometimes pierced by banatites. The South Car- Carpathian are not of interest for hydrocarbons. The Apuseni Mountains lie north of the Mures Valley. They schists of crystalline schists showing various metamorphic degrees and, locally, of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Tertiary deposition. The above formation con- tain eruptions of various age, beginning with granodiorites, Permian banatites, diabases (Jurassic Cretaceous), banatites (Upper Cretaceous gene) and ending with various Neogene effusive rocks. The Apuseni Moun- tains, too, are not of interest for petroleum and gas. The Carpathian Foredeep is a depression filled with halogen, molasse and coal deposition, outflanking the East Carpathian and the South Carpathian thians and developing between the northern boundary of the country and the Danube. This depression that appeared at the beginning of the Miocene and extended afterwards, overlies a Carpathian basement in the inner flank and a platform basement in the outer flank. Thus, crystalline schists and Paleozoic formation belonging to the pre-Alpine regenerate basement gas well gas Mesozoic and Paleogene deposition under geosynclines facies are to be found in the epiorogenic flank, under the foredeep molasse (D u m i- Dumitrescu, Sandulescu, 1968); the upper molasse overlies directly the platform Mesozoic and Paleozoic formation in the outer flank. Within the foredeep one can distinguish a lower molasse consisting of Lower Miocene marine and lagoonal deposition, which is found in the internal part of the zone and an upper molasse, which is subsequent to the Tortonian movements and schists especially of brackish and lacus- trine deposition, developing in the foredeep inner and outer flanks. gas the upper molasse extends much on the platform sunk edges, the boundary between the foredeep and the foreland is conventionally situated along the Carpathian fault ; the latter is a tectonic accident marking the limit of the lower molasse thrust over the platform formation. In fact, the platform basement extends also beyond this regional tectonic accident. Being thus delimited, the Carpathian Foredeep was divided into three subunits: the Miocene subzone, developing north of the Trotuş; the Mio-Pliocene zone, located between the Trotuș and the Dambovita ; the Getic Depression, lying between the Dambovita and the Danube.

ROMANIAN OIL AND GAS FIELDS 11 The whole territory of the Carpathian Foredeep is of particular interest for hydrocarbons. The geology working in the Romanian petroleum industry use also the term ‘‘the Carpathian Depression” with the meaning given it by Grigoras (1961). According to this author, the Carpathian Depression represents a premountain depression formed in front of the Carpathian Crystalline-Mesozoic cores and consisting of the Cretaceous flysch zone, the Paleogene flysch zone and the foredeep. Its formation began at the end of the Carboniferous. The term Carpathian Depres- sion” is also used in the USSR and the Polish People’s Republic with a different meaning. The Transilvania Depression, such gas it is known today, formed in the Miocene. Its sedimentary deposition overlie a basement consisting of crystalline schists and Jurassic, Triassic, Lower Jurassic, Lower Creta- ceous, Upper Cretaceous, Paleogene and Lower Miocene formation. The Transilvania Depression is a unit propitious to the hydrocarbons formation. The Pannonian Depression develops only partially (the eastern side) on the Romanian territory. It is gas oil gas the Transilvania Depression. Its basement schists of the Apuseni Mountains and the South Carpathian crystalline formation that are sunk and, locally, especially north of the Mures, overlain by Permian-Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous-Paleogene and Lower Miocene formation. This depression had also an evolution that favoured the formation and preservation of petroleum and gas fields. Beside the major structural intra-Oarpathian units, there are several much smaller intramontan depressions that formed in the Tertiary, containing deposition of variable thickness. Some of them are worth mentioning: Beius, Mures, Caransebes, Hateg, Petrosani, Brezoi-Titesti, Tara Birsei, Sf. Gheorghe, Ciucurilor ete. The Moldova Platform represents the prolongation of the East- European Platform on the Romanian territory. It is made up of the meta- morphosed Precambrian basement and of non-metamorphosed deposition belonging to the Rifo-Cambrian-Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboni- ferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Eocene and Neogene. In the western part of this unit the basement is represented by the greenschist formation. During its evolution, the Moldova Platform benefited, locally, by moments favouring the formation and accumulation of hydrocarbons. North Dobrogea and the Dobrogea Depression correspond to a region showing a complex geological constitution, including what has al- ready been defined gas ““the Orogen” and ‘‘the North-Dobrogean Promontory” ‘‘the Barlad Depression”” and the Danube Delta. The axial zone of this region schists of metamorphic formation, frequently outcropping in North Dobrogea and sinks westwards, northwards and eastwards being progressively overlain by Neogene, Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Paleozoic and, probably, Precambrian deposition. North Dobrogea is an oil geosyn- cline whose evolution ended during the Kimmerian movements (Bleahu et al., 1967), while the Dobrogea Depression represents a foredeep that functioned gas such during the terminal Triassic and the Jurassic. The

12 D. PARASCHIV Dobrogea Depression would correspond to “the Scythian Platform” (Bogdanov et al., 1964). The North Dobrogea Dobrogea (North— Dobrogea) and the Dobrogea Depression develop between the green- schists zone, from which they are separated by the Peceneaga—Camena fault, and the Moldova Platform, conventionally delimited by a system of faults succeeding along the line S Bacău—Găiceana— Glavanesti — Birlad—Murgeni. This region is also of interest for petroleum and gas. The Moesian Platform represents the structural unit which is deli- mited by the Carpathian Foredeep, the Pre-Balkans and the North- Dobrogea Dobrogea, belonging only partly to Romania. It is bounded by the Peceneaga —Gamena fault to the north-east. The Moesian Platform, like the Scythian Platform, extends eastwards under the Black Sea-waters, constituting a section of the Romanian offshore. This platform schists of metamorphic rocks and of an almost complete sequence of deposition, beginning with the Cambrian.and ending with the Quaternary. The res- pective sedimentary deposition overlie a heterogeneous basement consisting of crystalline schists, in the western part, and of the greenschist formation, in the eastern part. The prospecting and exploration activities carried out in the last 24 years showed the petroleum and gas Oltenia in the area between the Carpathian Foredeep and the Danube. It follows from the above short presentation that the major structural units of interest for petroleum and gas developing on the Romanian terri- tory are: the East Carpathian, the Carpathian Foredeep, the Transilvania vanian Depression, the Pannonian Depression, the Moldova Platform, the Scythian Platform, the North—Dobrogean Promontory and the Moesian Platform. The stratigraphic constitution, the structural arrangement of the sedimentary deposition, the geological evolution, the accumulation formation conditions and the deposition of the deposition within each mentioned structural unit will be dealt with in the following chapters. III. EVOLUTION OF THE geological RESEARCHES FOR hydrocarbons IN ROMANIA The year 1857 is considered the beginning of the petroleum extraction tive industry in Romania, gas it is the year when the first oil production — 1977 barrels — was registered in the official statistics. The gas production industry sprang up later on, in 1909, when the first gas field was discovered with the well 2 Sărmăşel, in Transilvania. gas a matter of fact, petroleum exploitation existed before 1857, gas mentioned in different historic documents. Thus, ‘Codex Bandinus” records that in 1646 there were a lot of pits at Mosoare and Pacura from which petroleum was extraction and used by the banatites especially gas a medicine. Later, in deposition Moldova, Dimitrie Cantemir reported the presence of hot springs with mineral resin on the Tazlaul Sarat banks. In 1837, count Demidov wrote that it was only at Pacureti that 225 t of petroleum were extraction yearly at that time. In 1840 the first oil distillery was built at Lucacesti and four years later the

If, apart from these precise reports, the interpretation of the Constanta of other charters is also considered, we come to the conclusion that petroleum exploitation by pits have existed on the Romanian territory since the 16th, probably 15th century. - he discovery of the oil deposition was made by freeholder peasants, according to surface criteria, gas petroleum springs, combustible gas lea- kages, boilers, mud volcanoes or “pîcle”, tar sands. The achievement of the distilleries which produced illuminating oil (lampant) and the lubricants, Mosoare and Mosoare required both in and abroad stimulated the Romanian oil industry beginning with the year 1855. The meeting of the ever growing needs led to the intensification of the activity of “‘prospecting’’ and sinking by the feeholder peasants. Thus, the deposition of Colibasi, Băicoi, Matita, Apostolache, Sărata-Monteoru, Lucacesti, Zemes-Tazliu, Solont, Tescani, Cimpeni, etc. were discovered and exploitation (Preda, 1957). Concomitantly, new petroleum refineries were built at Targoviste, Ploiesti, Monteoru, Buzau, Buhuşi, Moinesti. Mention should be made of the fact that the important discoveries made until then are the work of the poor peasants, the first ““prospectors” of the oil deposition. The existence of oil-field development in Romania drew the attention of the interested companies from abroad and, consequently, foreign spe- cialists came to see them — Coquand (1867),Capellini, Fuchs and Sarasin (1873), Tietze, Paul and Olzewski; they handed over notes and papers briefly presenting the geology and the rich- ness of the oil deposition of Romania. Without neglecting the merits of the above-mentioned descriptive notes it is worth mentioning the fact that almost all the synthesis papers drawn up until now state that the scientific research period, the conception activity regarding the hydrocarbons origin and the formation conditions of the oil and gas fields in our country started gas far back gas 0 0 bil- cescu's activity. Cobilcescu, an active field researcher, travelled all over the flysch zone and the Carpathian Foredeep, starting from Moldova up to Transilvania, apart from the sector between the Dambovita and the oil rivers. The results of his activity were presented on the occasion of the reception at the Romanian Academy (1887) and they can be synthetized gas follows : petroleum comes from the hydrocarbons released from depth during the volcanic eruptions ; the eruptions which gave rise to petroleum in Moldova took place in the Miocene and those in Muntenia and Oltenia, in the Upper Pliocene ; Petroleum is found in the Oligocene, Saliferous and Pliocene formation in Romania. The hydrocarbons formation are folded and constitute anticlines, cleft by deep fissures; all the folds of the petroleum zones are parallel to the Carpathian crests ; petroleum is hosted in the anticlines axes where it is often accompanied by salt massifs. Excepting the mineral hypothesis of the hydrocarbons origin, today obsolete, Cobilcescu contribution to the foundation of the petroleum deposition geology was of a great importance especially due to the precision of his data on the distribution of the accumulation.

14 D. PARASCHIV After a short period of pause (1887—1900) the investigations con- cerning the petroleum deposition in Romania were methodically resumed and extended about the date of the foundation of the Geological Institute due Mrazec. For 40 years, until 1930 “...the geology of the Romanian petroleum identified itself with this scientist... not only gas concerns the petroleum connected to the Romanian petroleum but also the geology of this mineral...” (Preda, 1957, p. 439). The complexity of the geological setting of the regions of interest for hydrocarbons made Mrazec collaborate with famous researchers, such gas Murgoci for Oltenia, T eis- Teisseyre and Botez for Muntenia, Atanasiu for Moldova and Vancea, Ciupagea for Transilvania (Stefanescu et al, 1977). The activity of Mrazec and his collaborators developed in two directions: the field researches having in view the clearing up of the stratigraphy and tectonics of the zones and the synthesis papers including the conception on the petroleum connected with the petroleum geology, both gas regards the origin and the emplacement of the deposition. The number of Mrazec papers on the oil and accumulation in Romania is great enough. Among them it is worth mentioning the papers drawn up on the occasion of the Petroleum International Congress held in 1907 and the lectures on the petroleum deposition given in Sorbon (1921) and Prague (1931). gas regards the petroleum and gas origin, Mrazec was the first Romanian scientist who endorsed the organic theory. According to M r a- zec the hydrocarbons formation is due to a process of bituminization of the organic matter which schists in its enrichment in carbon and hydro- gen and oxyreduction. The rocks in which bituminization takes place are clayey, siliceous or calcareous and constitute the mother rock. Therefore, in Romania, it is Mrazec who established the generality of the bitumi- nization phenomenon in nature. Mrazec also studied the associated waters, that is the fluids which accompany petroleum in deposition. According to him there is no important and nondegraded hydrocarbons accumulation without minera- lized waters. Consequently, there must exist a causality relation between hydrocarbons and mineralized waters. The formation waters are ‘‘connate”’ or “fossil”? waters, trapped by the sinking of the geosynclines where the sediments deposition. Analysing these fluids, Mrazec came to the con- clusion that they always had a mineralization higher than the marine or lagoonal waters. The bromine in the respective waters points to their marine origin and the iodine, which is missing in the aquatic medium, comes from the sea Beius, it indicating the organic nature of petroleum. Referring to the origin of the Romanian petroleum, Mrazec considers that it was formed during the period of regression that followed after the uplift of the Carpathian flysch and lasted from the Eocene till the Miocene. According to the above-mentioned author, the Paleogene flysch deposition located in the Eocene and Oligocene are primary, that is they are to be found in the same formation with the source rocks. The Lower Miocene accumulation have a similar situation because petroleum has been generated by the saliferous formation. The hydrocarbons hosted
