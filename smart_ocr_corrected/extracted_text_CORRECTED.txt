The South Carpathians are bounded by the Dimbovita Valley on the east and by the Danube on the south-west. They consist of crystalline schists and, here and there, Paleozoic non-metamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed rocks as well as Mesozoic deposits. The crystalline formations and the Paleozoic deposits are sometimes crossed by igneous rocks, especially by granites and granodiorites. The South Carpathians are characterized by a nappe structure. The autochthon, generally, consist of epizone schists with granitic intrusions and sedimentary deposits that rise up to the Upper Cretaceous on the stratigraphic scale. The formations overlying the autochthon tectonically make up the Getic Nappe and consist especially of crystalline schists that are overlain by Paleozoic and Mesozoic deposits. The latter are sometimes pierced by banatites. The South Carpathians are not of interest for hydrocarbons. The Apuseni Mountains lie north of the Mures Valley. They consists of crystalline schists showing various metamorphic degrees and, locally, of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Tertiary deposits. The above formations con- tain eruptions of various age, beginning with granites, Permian magmatites, diabases (Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous), banatites (Upper Cretaceous-Paleo- gene) and ending with various Neogene effusive rocks. The Apuseni Moun- tains, too, are not of interest for petroleum and gas. The Carpathian Foredeep is a depression filled with halogen, molasse and coal deposits, outflanking the East Carpathians and the South Carpa- thians and developing between the northern boundary of the country and the Danube. This depression that appeared at the beginning of the Miocene and extended afterwards, overlies a Carpathian basement in the inner flank and a platform basement in the outer flank. Thus, crystalline schists and Paleozoic formations belonging to the pre-Alpine regenerate basement as well as Mesozoic and Paleogene deposits under geosyncline facies are to be found in the epiorogenic flank, under the foredeep molasse (D u m i- trescu, Săndulescu, 1968); the upper molasse overlies directly the platform Mesozoic and Paleozoic formations in the outer flank. Within the foredeep one can distinguish a lower molasse consisting of Lower Miocene marine and lagoonal deposits, which is found in the internal part of the zone and an upper molasse, which is subsequent to the Tortonian movements and consists especially of brackish and lacus- trine deposits, developing in the foredeep inner and outer flanks. As the upper molasse extends much on the platform sunk edges, the boundary between the foredeep and the foreland is conventionally situated along the Pericarpathian fault ; the latter is a tectonic accident marking the limit of the lower molasse thrust over the platform formations. In fact, the platform basement extends also beyond this regional tectonic accident. Being thus delimited, the Carpathian Foredeep was divided into three subunits: the Miocene subzone, developing north of the Trotuş; the Mio-Pliocene zone, located between the Trotuș and the Dimbovita ; the Getic Depression, lying between the Dimbovita and the Danube.

ROMANIAN OIL AND GAS FIELDS 11 The whole territory of the Carpathian Foredeep is of particular interest for hydrocarbons. The geologists working in the Romanian petroleum industry use also the term ‘‘the Precarpathian Depression” with the meaning given it by Grigoras (1961). According to this author, the Precarpathian Depression represents a premountain depression formed in front of the Carpathian Crystalline-Mesozoic cores and consisting of the Cretaceous flysch zone, the Paleogene flysch zone and the foredeep. Its formation began at the end of the Carboniferous. The term ‘‘Precarpathian Depres- sion” is also used in the USSR and the Polish People’s Republic with a different meaning. The Transylvanian Depression, such as it is known today, formed in the Miocene. Its sedimentary deposits overlie a basement consisting of crystalline schists and Jurassic, Triassic, Lower Jurassic, Lower Cretaceous, Upper Cretaceous, Paleogene and Lower Miocene formations. The Transylvanian Depression is a unit propitious to the hydrocarbon formation. The Pannonian Depression develops only partially (the eastern side) on the Romanian territory. It is as old as the Transylvanian Depression. Its basement consists of the Apuseni Mountains and the South Carpathians crystalline formations that are sunk and, locally, especially north of the Mures, overlain by Permian-Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous-Paleogene and Lower Miocene formations. This depression had also an evolution that favoured the formation and preservation of petroleum and gas fields. Beside the major structural intra-Oarpathian units, there are several much smaller intramontan depressions that formed in the Tertiary, containing deposits of variable thickness. Some of them are worth mentioning: Beius, Mures, Caransebes, Hateg, Petrosani, Brezoi-Titesti, Tara Birsei, Sf. Gheorghe, Ciucurilor ete. The Moldavian Platform represents the prolongation of the East- European Platform on the Romanian territory. It is made up of the meta- morphosed Precambrian basement and of non-metamorphosed deposits belonging to the Rifo-Cambrian-Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboni- ferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Eocene and Neogene. In the western part of this unit the basement is represented by the greenschist formation. During its evolution, the Moldavian Platform benefited, locally, by moments favouring the formation and accumulation of hydrocarbons. North Dobrogea and the Predobrogean Depression correspond to a region showing a complex geological constitution, including what has al- ready been defined as ““the Orogen” and ‘‘the North-Dobrogean Promontory” ‘‘the Birlad Depression”” and the Danube Delta. The axial zone of this region consists of metamorphic formations, frequently outcropping in North Dobrogea and sinks westwards, northwards and eastwards being progressively overlain by Neogene, Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Paleozoic and, probably, Precambrian deposits. North Dobrogea is an old geosyn- cline whose evolution ended during the Kimmerian movements (Bleahu et al., 1967), while the Predobrogean Depression represents a foredeep that functioned as such during the terminal Triassic and the Jurassic. The

12 D. PARASCHIV Predobrogean Depression would correspond to “the Scythian Platform” (Bogdanof et al., 1964). The North Dobrogean Orogen (North— Dobrogea) and the Predobrogean Depression develop between the green- schist zone, from which they are separated by the Peceneaga—Camena fault, and the Moldavian Platform, conventionally delimited by a system of faults succeeding along the line S Bacău—Găiceana— Glăvăneşti — Birlad—Murgeni. This region is also of interest for petroleum and gas. The Moesian Platform represents the structural unit which is deli- mited by the Carpathian Foredeep, the Pre-Balkans and the North- Dobrogean Orogen, belonging only partly to Romania. It is bounded by the Peceneaga —Gamena fault to the north-east. The Moesian Platform, like the Scythian Platform, extends eastwards under the Black Sea-waters, constituting a section of the Romanian offshore. This platform consists of metamorphic rocks and of an almost complete sequence of deposits, beginning with the Cambrian.and ending with the Quaternary. The res- pective sedimentary deposits overlie a heterogeneous basement consisting of crystalline schists, in the western part, and of the greenschist formation, in the eastern part. The prospecting and exploration activities carried out in the last 24 years showed the petroleum and gas potential in the area between the Carpathian Foredeep and the Danube. It follows from the above short presentation that the major structural units of interest for petroleum and gas developing on the Romanian terri- tory are: the East Carpathians, the Carpathian Foredeep, the Transylvanian Depression, the Pannonian Depression, the Moldavian Platform, the Scythian Platform, the North—Dobrogean Promontory and the Moesian Platform. The stratigraphic constitution, the structural arrangement of the sedimentary deposits, the geological evolution, the accumulation formation conditions and the description of the deposits within each mentioned structural unit will be dealt with in the following chapters. III. EVOLUTION OF THE GEOLOGIGAL RESEARCHES FOR HYDROGARBONS IN ROMANIA The year 1857 is considered the beginning of the petroleum extrac- tive industry in Romania, as it is the year when the first oil production — 1977 barrels — was registered in the official statistics. The gas production industry sprang up later on, in 1909, when the first gas field was discovered with the well 2 Sărmăşel, in Transylvania. As a matter of fact, petroleum exploitation existed before 1857, as mentioned in different historic documents. Thus, ‘Codex Bandinus” records that in 1646 there were a lot of pits at Mosoare and Păcura from which petroleum was extracted and used by the natives especially as a medicine. Later, in ‘Descriptio Moldaviae”, Dimitrie Cantemir reported the presence of hot springs with mineral resin on the Tazlăul Sarat banks. In 1837, count Demidov wrote that it was only at Păcureţi that 225 t of petroleum were extracted yearly at that time. In 1840 the first oil distillery was built at Lucăceşti and four years later the

ROMANIAN OL AND GAS FIELDS 13 second ‘‘oil pump’’ sprang up. If, apart from these precise reports, the interpretation of the content of other charters is also considered, we come to the conclusion that petroleum exploitations by pits have existed on the Romanian territory since the 16th, probably 15th century. - he discovery of the oil deposits was made by freeholder peasants, according to surface criteria, as petroleum springs, combustible gas lea- kages, boilers, mud volcanoes or “pîcle”, tar sands. The achievement of the distilleries which produced illuminating oil (lampant) and the lubricants, more and more required both in and abroad stimulated the Romanian oil industry beginning with the year 1855. The meeting of the ever growing needs led to the intensification of the activity of “‘prospecting’’ and sinking by the feeholder peasants. Thus, the deposits of Colibasi, Băicoi, Matita, Apostolache, Sărata-Monteoru, Lucăceşti, Zemes-Tazliu, Solont, Tescani, Cimpeni, etc. were discovered and exploited (Preda, 1957). Concomitantly, new petroleum refineries were built at Tirgoviste, Ploiesti, Monteoru, Buzău, Buhuşi, Moineşti. Mention should be made of the fact that the important discoveries made until then are the work of the poor peasants, the first ““prospectors” of the oil deposits. The existence of oil-field development in Romania drew the attention of the interested companies from abroad and, consequently, foreign spe- cialists came to see them — Coquand (1867),Capellini, Fuchs and Sarasin (1873), Tietze, Paul and Olzewski; they handed over notes and papers briefly presenting the geology and the rich- ness of the oil deposits of Romania. Without neglecting the merits of the above-mentioned descriptive notes it is worth mentioning the fact that almost all the synthesis papers drawn up until now state that the scientific research period, the conception activity regarding the hydrocarbon origin and the formation conditions of the oil and gas fields in our country started as far back as 0 0 bil- cescu's activity. Cobilcescu, an active field researcher, travelled all over the flysch zone and the Carpathian Foredeep, starting from Moldavia up to Transylvania, apart from the sector between the Dimbovita and the Olt rivers. The results of his activity were presented on the occasion of the reception at the Romanian Academy (1887) and they can be synthetized as follows : petroleum comes from the hydrocarbons released from depth during the volcanic eruptions ; the eruptions which gave rise to petroleum in Moldavia took place in the Miocene and those in Muntenia and Oltenia, in the Upper Pliocene ; Petroleum is found in the Oligocene, Saliferous and Pliocene formations in Romania. The hydrocarbon-bearing formations are folded and constitute anticlines, cleft by deep fissures; all the folds of the petroliferous zones are parallel to the Carpathian crests ; petroleum is hosted in the anticlinal axes where it is often accompanied by salt massifs. Excepting the mineral hypothesis of the hydrocarbon origin, today obsolete, Cobilcescu’s contribution to the foundation of the petroleum deposits geology was of a great importance especially due to the precision of his data on the distribution of the accumulations.

14 D. PARASCHIV After a short period of pause (1887—1900) the investigations con- cerning the petroleum deposits in Romania were methodically resumed and extended about the date of the foundation of the Geological Institute due toMrazec. For 40 years, until 1930 “...the geology of the Romanian petroleum identified itself with this scientist... not only as concerns the problems connected to the Romanian petroleum but also the geology of this mineral...” (Preda, 1957, p. 439). The complexity of the geological setting of the regions of interest for hydrocarbons made Mrazec collaborate with famous researchers, such as Murgoci for Oltenia, T eis- seyre and Botez for Muntenia, Atanasiu for Moldavia and Vancea, Ciupagea for Transylvania (Stefanescu et al, 1977). The activity of Mrazec and his collaborators developed in two directions: the field researches having in view the clearing up of the stratigraphy and tectonics of the zones and the synthesis papers including the conception on the problems connected with the petroleum geology, both as regards the origin and the emplacement of the deposits. The number of Mrazec’s papers on the oil and accumulations in Romania is great enough. Among them it is worth mentioning the papers drawn up on the occasion of the Petroleum International Congress held in 1907 and the lectures on the petroleum deposits given in Sorbon (1921) and Prague (1931). As regards the petroleum and gas origin, Mrazec was the first Romanian scientist who endorsed the organic theory. According to M r a- zec the hydrocarbon formation is due to a process of bituminization of the organic matter which consists in its enrichment in carbon and hydro- gen and oxyreduction. The rocks in which bituminization takes place are clayey, siliceous or calcareous and constitute the mother rock. Therefore, in Romania, it is Mrazec who established the generality of the bitumi- nization phenomenon in nature. Mrazec also studied the associated waters, that is the fluids which accompany petroleum in deposits. According to him there is no important and nondegraded hydrocarbon accumulation without minera- lized waters. Consequently, there must exist a causality relation between hydrocarbons and mineralized waters. The formation waters are ‘‘connate”’ or “fossil”? waters, trapped by the sinking of the “‘geosynclines” where the sediments deposited. Analysing these fluids, Mrazec came to the con- clusion that they always had a mineralization higher than the marine or lagoonal waters. The bromine in the respective waters points to their marine origin and the iodine, which is missing in the aquatic medium, comes from the sea beings, it indicating the organic nature of petroleum. Referring to the origin of the Romanian petroleum, Mrazec considers that it was formed during the period of regression that followed after the uplift of the Carpathian flysch and lasted from the Eocene till the Miocene. According to the above-mentioned author, the Paleogene flysch deposits located in the Eocene and Oligocene are primary, that is they are to be found in the same formation with the source rocks. The Lower Miocene accumulations have a similar situation because petroleum has been generated by the saliferous formation. The hydrocarbons hosted
